The program test-lib will exercise all the functions of the library (unless it
is not kept up to date - all changes to the library should be immediately 
reflected in test-lib.c).

It will produce lots of output files to prove it is doing its i/o functions
properly.  These are called out.*.  Running the script "test.csh" will remove
these files before running test-lib.

The file test-lib.c is also an example of how to use the library.
