/*******************************************************************************
MODULE NAME
ut_types

ONE-LINE SYNOPSIS
Code related to very general data types and constants.

SCOPE OF THIS MODULE
Data types and constants which are more specific to other modules should go
there.  This module is meant to include those concepts which are more general.
For instance, the constants UT_PI and UT_E are in ut_math since they will only
come into play when mathematical computations are being done.  UT_TRUE and
UT_FALSE are in this module because they see more universal usage.
