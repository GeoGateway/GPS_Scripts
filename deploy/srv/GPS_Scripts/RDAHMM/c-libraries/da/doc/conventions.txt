Some Conventions
----------------

- function names that end in _pp denote parallel functions, i.e. functions that
	do a different thing depending on which pe you are

- malloc memory at the highest level in the program rather than where it is
	directly needed; i.e. pass in all arrays, etc. from the highest level (main)
	- this is better for efficiency, esp. when the function is called multiple
		times
	- shows you exactly what the memory requirement is; less hidden costs
